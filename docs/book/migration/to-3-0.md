# Migration guide

Migration guide for Laminas Cache version 3.0.0.

## New Features

- Each cache adapter has its [own package](#satellite-packages).

## Breaking Changes

- Removal of support for `laminas/laminas-servicemanager` and the related files
    - `PatternPluginManagerV2Polyfill`
    - `PatternPluginManagerV3Polyfill`
    - `PatternPluginManagerTrait`

## Satellite packages

Starting with laminas-cache v3, we are introducing satellite packages for each cache backend.

In order to make this package work, you have to specify at least **one** satellite package.

A list of available cache adapters can be found here. `TODO: add link to documentation`.
